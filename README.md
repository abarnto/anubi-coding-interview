# Anubi Digital Coding Interview

This repository has been created with the sole purpose of letting new applicants show what they are truly capable of, using their hard skills and soft skills.

## Introduction

At Anubi Digital we ‚ù§Ô∏è Javascript. As a matter of fact, every application we craft is done in JS. But of course, we would be crazy to code vanilla JS. Therefore we chose among the best frameworks out there, to help us create wonderful products that can have word-wide impact among crypto adopters. Our stack is made up by:

- Next JS, a React Framework `[FrontEnd]`
- Nest JS, a Node Js Framework `[BackEnd]`

Together combined, they are the layer where we build our main platform which currently consist of:

- Main monolithic backend (plus a DB)
- Landing page
- Customer Web App
- Back-office Dashboard

That's why we have set up this coding interview to mock part of our main coding infrastructure, so that letting you understand if you find it fun and challenging enough to join us in our mission.

## Your Challenge

We want to make sure we onboard talented people who are willing to join our mission in creating cutting-edge apps. But since we are dealing with high sensitive data and delicate operations we have to ensure you are a responsible person who can get the job done no matter what the odds are.

Your mission, if you choose to accept it, would be implementing a `REST Get endpoint` to gather mocked data, and presenting it on the `Home Page` of the fake customer.

The following, is a full list of requirements you will be evaluated on.

### Evaluation tasks

Tasks are not order-locked, meaning that you are not required to complete all the tasks in order (even if we strongly recommend trying). You can submit you work even if not all of the challenges have been completed.

#### üë∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Basic Level (Required for submission)

_Backend_

1. Install dependencies and start the server
2. Inspect the available API

_Frontend_ (Small Admin Dashboard)

1. Create a `table component` to view transactions data, labelling transaction `Nature` in such a way to be clearly visible at a glance.
2. Install and configure [TailWind](https://tailwindcss.com/) for component stylings, and use your creativity to improve the basic table you have just created
3. Fetch transactions data using the `GET:transactions` endpoint

#### üë®‚Äçüéì Advanced

_Backend_

1. Paginate the `GET:transactions` endpoint to return `5 elements` per page **(hint: use the date as index)**
2. Implement the `GET:balances` endpoint so to have the current balance for each user and asset
3. Implement the `processUserInterests` method inside the class AppService
4. Setup a GraphQL endpoint and add a mutation that given a user id, an asset id and a date it will invoke `processUserInterests` method

_Frontend_ (Small Admin Dashboard)

1. Organize the fetching function in an [Hook](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-custom.html)
2. Add paging to the table, letting the admin switch between page 1 and page 2
3. Show customers' balance in the `/balance` route, creating cards components for each user-asset pair, and it's balance sum
4. Configure an Apollo client in order to fetch the data from the GraphQL endpoint created in Backend Step4 and create a form that will invoke the user interests process routine inside a new route named `/interests`
